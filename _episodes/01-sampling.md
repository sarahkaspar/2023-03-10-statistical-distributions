> ## Quiz question
>
> Which of the following statements are true?  
>   1. A probability distribution assigns probabilities to possible outcomes of an experiment.  
>   2. The probabilities in a statistical distribution sum/integrate up to 1.  
>   3. If the experiments are not randomized, the results don't follow a statistical distribution.  
> > ## Solution
> >
> > Answers 1 and 2 are correct. To 3: If experiments are not randomized, the results still follow some distribution, but they are likely to not represent reality well.
